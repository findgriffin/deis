Platform monitoring
=========================

Comprehensive platform monitoring is a goal for Deis 1.0. We are currently investigating solutions
for this, and progress can be tracked in GitHub issue `#981`_.

A requirement for this monitoring system would be to:

* Track system metrics (CPU, memory, etc.)
* Report Deis component failure
* Track deployed application container states and metrics

Platform monitoring is an ongoing discussion, and feedback is much appreciated in issue `#981`_.
