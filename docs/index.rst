Deis (pronounced DAY-iss) is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications
on your own servers. Deis builds upon Docker and CoreOS to provide a lightweight PaaS with a
Heroku-inspired workflow.

To get started with Deis, first read the :ref:`about` section to get a better
understanding of Deis and its architecture.

The full documentation tree can be seen :ref:`here <toctree>`.
